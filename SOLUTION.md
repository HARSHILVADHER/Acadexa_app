# SharedPreferences Plugin Error Solution

## The Problem
`MissingPluginException (No implementation found for method getAll on channel plugins.flutter.io/shared_preferences)`

## The Solution

### Step 1: Stop the app completely
- Stop the Flutter app if it's running
- Close the emulator/simulator if using one

### Step 2: Clean and rebuild
Run these commands in your project directory:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Restart your development environment
- If using VS Code, close and reopen it
- If using Android Studio, close and reopen it
- Restart your emulator/simulator

### Step 4: Run the app again
```bash
flutter run
```

## What was implemented:

1. **Temp Storage Fallback**: Created a temporary storage system that works even if SharedPreferences fails
2. **Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks around SharedPreferences calls
3. **Dual Storage**: The app now stores user data in both SharedPreferences and temporary storage
4. **Graceful Degradation**: If SharedPreferences fails, the app continues working with temporary storage

## Files Modified:
- `lib/services/temp_storage.dart` (NEW)
- `lib/services/user_service.dart` (UPDATED)
- `lib/pages/email.dart` (UPDATED)
- `pubspec.yaml` (UPDATED)

The app should now work even if SharedPreferences has issues, and will display the correct user name and time-based greeting.
